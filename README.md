# PAN Card Tampering Detection Using SSIM and Flask
This project detects tampering in PAN card images using image processing techniques. It compares an original and a possibly tampered image using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), highlights the differences, and visualizes the tampered regions. A Flask web app is also included for users to upload and check PAN cards via a browser.
